/**
 * Manual Test Instructions for File Explorer to Monaco Editor Connection
 * 
 * This file contains test scenarios to verify that task 5.3 is properly implemented.
 * 
 * Test Scenarios:
 * 
 * 1. File Opening in Editor Tabs
 *    - Click on a file in the file explorer
 *    - Verify that the file opens in a new tab in Monaco Editor
 *    - Verify that the file content is loaded correctly
 *    - Verify that syntax highlighting is applied based on file extension
 * 
 * 2. Multiple File Editing
 *    - Open multiple files from the file explorer
 *    - Verify that each file opens in a separate tab
 *    - Switch between tabs and verify content is preserved
 *    - Verify that each tab shows the correct file name
 * 
 * 3. File Content Loading and Saving
 *    - Open a file from the explorer
 *    - Modify the content in Monaco Editor
 *    - Verify that the tab shows an unsaved changes indicator (orange dot)
 *    - Save the file using Ctrl+S or the Save button
 *    - Verify that the unsaved changes indicator disappears
 *    - Verify that the file is saved to the backend
 * 
 * 4. Unsaved Changes Detection and Warnings
 *    - Open a file and make changes without saving
 *    - Try to close the tab
 *    - Verify that an unsaved changes dialog appears
 *    - Test all three options: Save, Don't Save, Cancel
 *    - Try to switch to another tab with unsaved changes
 *    - Verify that the warning dialog appears
 *    - Try to open a new file with unsaved changes
 *    - Verify that the warning dialog appears
 * 
 * 5. File Status Indicators in Explorer
 *    - Open files from the explorer
 *    - Verify that open files are highlighted in blue in the explorer
 *    - Make changes to open files
 *    - Verify that modified files show orange highlighting and a dot indicator
 *    - Save files and verify indicators update correctly
 * 
 * 6. New File Creation
 *    - Click the "New File" button in the tab bar
 *    - Verify that a new untitled file is created and opened
 *    - Verify that the file is marked as modified (unsaved)
 *    - Save the file and verify it's created in the workspace
 * 
 * 7. Directory Handling
 *    - Click on directories in the file explorer
 *    - Verify that directories expand/collapse but don't open in editor
 *    - Verify that only files open in the Monaco Editor
 * 
 * 8. Error Handling
 *    - Try to open a file that doesn't exist or fails to load
 *    - Verify that an error message is displayed
 *    - Verify that a tab is still created with default content
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * - File explorer and Monaco Editor are properly connected
 * - Files open seamlessly from explorer to editor
 * - Multiple files can be edited simultaneously with proper tab management
 * - Unsaved changes are detected and user is warned appropriately
 * - File status is clearly indicated in both explorer and editor
 * - New files can be created directly from the editor
 * - Error conditions are handled gracefully
