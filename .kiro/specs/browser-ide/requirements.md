# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive browser-based IDE that allows users to write, edit, and execute code in multiple programming languages directly in their web browser. The IDE will feature real-time collaboration, Google Drive integration, and containerized code execution, providing a complete development environment accessible from anywhere.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend IDE Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern browser-based code editor with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense, so that I can write code efficiently without installing local development tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the IDE THEN the system SHALL display a Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting
2. WHEN a user types code THEN the system SHALL provide IntelliSense and autocomplete suggestions
3. WHEN a user opens multiple files THEN the system SHALL display them in separate tabs
4. WHEN a user navigates the file explorer THEN the system SHALL show a tree view of the workspace
5. IF a user selects a programming language THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate syntax highlighting and language features

### Requirement 2: Integrated Terminal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an integrated terminal in the browser, so that I can run commands and see output without switching between applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the terminal THEN the system SHALL display an xterm.js terminal interface
2. WHEN a user types commands in the terminal THEN the system SHALL execute them in the backend container
3. WHEN commands produce output THEN the system SHALL stream the results back to the terminal in real-time
4. WHEN a user runs code THEN the system SHALL display execution logs and output in the terminal

### Requirement 3: Multi-Language Code Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute code in multiple programming languages, so that I can work on diverse projects without worrying about local environment setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a runtime (Node.js, Python, Java, C++, Go, etc.) THEN the system SHALL prepare the appropriate execution environment
2. WHEN a user clicks "Run" THEN the system SHALL execute the code in a Docker container with the selected runtime
3. WHEN code execution begins THEN the system SHALL stream logs and output back to the user interface
4. IF code execution fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and stack traces
5. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL show the final output and execution time

### Requirement 4: Real-time Collaboration

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate with others on code in real-time, so that we can pair program and work together efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users open the same workspace THEN the system SHALL sync their cursors and selections in real-time
2. WHEN a user makes edits THEN the system SHALL propagate changes to all connected users using Yjs CRDT
3. WHEN users are present THEN the system SHALL display presence indicators with different colors for each user
4. WHEN a user joins a collaborative session THEN the system SHALL show their cursor and name to other participants

### Requirement 5: Google Drive Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sync my workspace with Google Drive, so that my files are automatically backed up and accessible from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in with Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL request Drive access permissions
2. WHEN a user clicks "Mount Drive" THEN the system SHALL display their Google Drive files in the file explorer
3. WHEN a user saves files THEN the system SHALL automatically sync changes to Google Drive
4. WHEN a user opens the IDE THEN the system SHALL load their most recent workspace from Google Drive
5. IF Drive sync fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow manual retry

### Requirement 6: User Authentication and Sessions

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication and session management, so that my work is protected and I can resume where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the IDE THEN the system SHALL prompt for Google OAuth login
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL issue a JWT token for session management
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session and clear local data

### Requirement 7: Workspace Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and manage multiple projects, so that I can organize my work and switch between different codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL initialize a new workspace with default structure
2. WHEN a user switches projects THEN the system SHALL load the selected workspace and its files
3. WHEN a user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL remove all associated files and data
4. WHEN a user renames a project THEN the system SHALL update the workspace metadata accordingly

### Requirement 8: Git Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Git version control integrated into the IDE, so that I can manage my code repositories without external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initializes Git THEN the system SHALL create a Git repository in the workspace container
2. WHEN a user commits changes THEN the system SHALL execute Git commands and show the commit status
3. WHEN a user pushes to remote THEN the system SHALL authenticate with GitHub and sync the repository
4. WHEN a user clones a repository THEN the system SHALL download the code into a new workspace
5. IF Git operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 9: Language Server Protocol Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced IDE features like go-to-definition and error checking, so that I can write code more efficiently with better tooling support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a file THEN the system SHALL start the appropriate Language Server (LSP) for that language
2. WHEN a user hovers over code THEN the system SHALL display type information and documentation
3. WHEN a user uses go-to-definition THEN the system SHALL navigate to the symbol's declaration
4. WHEN code has errors THEN the system SHALL display red squiggly underlines and error messages
5. WHEN a user requests code formatting THEN the system SHALL apply language-specific formatting rules

### Requirement 10: Security and Sandboxing

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want secure code execution that prevents malicious code from affecting the system, so that the platform remains safe for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code executes THEN the system SHALL run it in an isolated Docker container with limited resources
2. WHEN containers are created THEN the system SHALL apply CPU and memory limits to prevent resource abuse
3. WHEN network access is required THEN the system SHALL restrict outbound connections to approved domains only
4. IF malicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL terminate the container and log the incident
5. WHEN containers finish execution THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and remove temporary data
