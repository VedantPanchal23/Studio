# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the browser-based IDE from TailwindCSS to plain CSS and upgrading the icon system to use professional icons similar to those used by Kiro and VSCode. This migration aims to provide better control over styling, reduce bundle size, and improve the overall visual consistency with professional development tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TailwindCSS Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IDE to use plain CSS instead of TailwindCSS, so that I have more direct control over styling and reduce framework dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL NOT include TailwindCSS dependencies
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use plain CSS classes instead of Tailwind utility classes
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL have a smaller CSS bundle size compared to the TailwindCSS version
4. WHEN styles are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual appearance as the original design
5. IF custom styling is needed THEN the system SHALL use standard CSS properties and selectors

### Requirement 2: Plain CSS Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized plain CSS that follows modern best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows standard web development patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS files are created THEN the system SHALL organize styles using CSS modules or BEM methodology
2. WHEN styles are written THEN the system SHALL use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
3. WHEN responsive design is needed THEN the system SHALL use CSS media queries instead of Tailwind responsive utilities
4. WHEN layouts are created THEN the system SHALL use CSS Grid and Flexbox for positioning
5. IF animations are required THEN the system SHALL use CSS transitions and keyframes

### Requirement 3: Professional Icon System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the IDE to use professional-grade icons similar to VSCode and Kiro, so that the interface looks polished and familiar to developers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN icons are displayed THEN the system SHALL use SVG-based icon components instead of emoji or basic symbols
2. WHEN file types are shown THEN the system SHALL display appropriate file type icons (similar to VSCode file explorer)
3. WHEN UI actions are available THEN the system SHALL use consistent iconography for buttons and menu items
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display icons that match the professional aesthetic of modern IDEs
5. IF new icons are needed THEN the system SHALL source them from a professional icon library or create custom SVG icons

### Requirement 4: Icon Library Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent icon system that's easy to maintain and extend, so that adding new icons or updating existing ones is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN icons are implemented THEN the system SHALL use a centralized icon component system
2. WHEN new icons are added THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent naming convention and sizing standard
3. WHEN icons are used THEN the system SHALL support different sizes (16px, 20px, 24px) for various UI contexts
4. WHEN themes change THEN the system SHALL support icon color variations for light and dark modes
5. IF accessibility is required THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels and alt text for icons

### Requirement 5: Component Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing UI components to be migrated from Tailwind to plain CSS, so that the entire application uses a consistent styling approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are refactored THEN the system SHALL convert all Tailwind classes to equivalent plain CSS
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have no remaining Tailwind utility classes in the codebase
3. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL maintain identical visual appearance and behavior
4. WHEN new components are created THEN the system SHALL use the new plain CSS approach
5. IF component functionality changes THEN the system SHALL ensure CSS updates don't break existing features

### Requirement 6: Build System Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to be optimized for plain CSS, so that development and production builds are efficient without TailwindCSS processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build runs THEN the system SHALL remove TailwindCSS from the build pipeline
2. WHEN CSS is processed THEN the system SHALL use PostCSS for autoprefixing and optimization
3. WHEN the application is built for production THEN the system SHALL minify and optimize CSS files
4. WHEN development mode runs THEN the system SHALL provide fast CSS hot reloading
5. IF CSS imports are used THEN the system SHALL properly resolve and bundle CSS modules

### Requirement 7: Theme System Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark/light theme system to work seamlessly with plain CSS, so that I can switch themes without any visual issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN themes are switched THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate CSS custom properties for colors
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL use dark theme color variables throughout the interface
3. WHEN light mode is active THEN the system SHALL use light theme color variables throughout the interface
4. WHEN theme changes occur THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between color schemes
5. IF new theme colors are needed THEN the system SHALL define them in CSS custom properties

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load faster and use less bandwidth after the CSS migration, so that the IDE performs better overall.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL have a smaller total CSS bundle size than the TailwindCSS version
2. WHEN styles are applied THEN the system SHALL have faster initial render times
3. WHEN CSS is cached THEN the system SHALL leverage browser caching more effectively
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL have reduced memory usage from CSS processing
5. IF performance metrics are measured THEN the system SHALL show improved Lighthouse scores for performance
